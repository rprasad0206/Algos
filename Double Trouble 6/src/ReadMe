1. The instantiation of the fundamental combinatorial game called "Double Trouble" is actually know as a game called
"Nim" or "3 5 7 Nim" in this case. The game is said to have been originated in China and it closely resembles "jian-shizi"
which is a game of picking stones. The game of Nim was first analyzed mathematically by the mathematician Charles Bouton in 1901,
and its optimal strategy was later formalized by mathematician and computer scientist Elwyn Berlekamp in the 1960s.
The game of Nim has appeared in popular culture in various forms. In the movie "WarGames" (1983),
the main character David Lightman uses the game of Nim to teach his computer how to learn. It appears a lot in other videogames,
and puzzles.


In the game of 3 5 7 Nim, Players take turns removing any amount of items from 1 of the 3 piles if there are markers available
in the pile.
The players keep taking turns removing items until the player who makes the last move wins.
The XOR sum strategy can be used to determine the winning moves.
To use this strategy, you first convert the number of markers of each color into binary form.
Then, you calculate the XOR sum of the binary numbers for each pile.
The XOR sum is obtained by adding the binary digits of the numbers in each color.
Now, the player who moves first should try to make the XOR sum equal to zero.
If the XOR sum is already zero, then the first player should make a move that keeps the XOR sum zero.
If the XOR sum is not zero, then the first player should make a move that changes the XOR sum to zero.
If the first player plays optimally and makes the XOR sum zero,
then the second player can only make moves that change the XOR sum back to a non-zero value.
This means that the first player will eventually win the game if they play optimally.
